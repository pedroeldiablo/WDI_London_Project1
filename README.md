A JS Game

The idea for Seeing Red started with the idea of developing a vision based game.

On looking into possible options for the color scheme I encountered research into color blindness, color vision deficiency, or CVD and how to make a more accessible web.

The web is a very visual environment, but for a significant portion of the population (around 6% of men and 1 in 200 women) a significant amount of this information is hard to distinguish.

At this time I decided to look into the possibility of turning this into a more practical application.

The design of the game play is built around colored spots. These echo the ink dots that are the foundation for the most commonly used test for color blindness the Ishihara Test.

In the standard version of the game the color palette has been selected to be tonal if viewed in grey scale. This means that for the majority of users they will be able to play regardless of any CVD.

The game play is fairly simple. Once created the board disappears in two ways. Firstly the bottom dots in the grid are eaten. Secondly at timed intervals a whole color disappears.

To keep to game alive simply click the black spots to replace some of the colored spots at the top of the board as they disappear.

Your score is based on a combination of the number of spots you click and the number of black spots still on board at the time. This encourages you to try and save the lowest dots first in preference to just rapidly reclicking the same spot.
